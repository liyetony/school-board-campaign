    Thank you for your support! Fundraising is essential to a successful
    campaign, and we appreciate anything you can chip in to help reach those in
    our community. Your donation will pay for printing costs, advertising, and
    more. Anything leftover after the campaign is over will be donated back into
    the schools.
