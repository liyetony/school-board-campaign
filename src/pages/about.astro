    She has always had the heart to serve others, serving in the childrenâ€™s
    ministry by teaching preschoolers on Sundays monthly from middle school
    through high school. Ariana took this passion for helping others into her
    volunteering, collegiate studies, and professional pursuits.

      She worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs Northern California
      Health Care System as part of their Student Temporary Employment program
      throughout college. As an alumna of the University of California Irvine
      with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, she gained statistical, research,
      and leadership experience in the areas of cognitive psychology, social
      sciences, organizational development, and education. This experience
      helped her better advocate for her younger sister's mental health and
      special education needs within the Benicia Unified School District. Ariana
      also continued to show support for the arts in Benicia schools through the
      years and coached Benicia Middle School students as a Colorguard
      Instructor.

    During her time as a graduate student, Ariana worked with different programs
    in a variety of health care and agency settings such as Kaiser Permanente,
    Orange County Department of Education (OCDE), and school districts.
  </p>
  <p>
    She applied evidenced based, person-in-environment, and problem solving
    approaches to program evaluation, crisis response, and providing mental
    health services to students.
  </p>
  <p>
    During her time working at OCDE - Safe Schools & Support Services, she
    gained experience working with students, parents, teachers, and school
    administrators to support Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug prevention,
    Anti-Bullying, Individual and Group Crisis Response, and Gang Intervention
    across schools in Orange County.
  </p>
  <p>
    After graduating, Ariana worked as a Social Worker for Contra Costa County
    Children and Family Services and has since been promoted to a Staff
    Development Specialist, applying her child welfare experience to train new
    Social Workers and support the workforce in serving children, families, and
    communities through the pandemic.
  </p>
  <p>
    She learned to quickly pivot to meet the needs of her staff from various
    backgrounds and levels of experiences by adapting curriculum to a hybrid
    training model and developing new simulation curriculum to better prepare
    them for the field. While working full time, Ariana has continued her
    professional development as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, keeping her
    clinical skills sharp on the most recent research and best practices for
    serving children and youth to support their social, emotional, and
    behavioral health.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, Ariana helped her local community by developing and
    facilitating the Understanding Mental Health class for Northgate Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    This class opened her eyes to the changes that are possible in peopleâ€™s
    lives when they come together to share their experiences with one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Social Worker caring for foster and at-risk youth, Ariana knows
    firsthand the importance of equity in education. She assessed and supported
    the safety, permanency, and well-being of the children and youth she served.
    She has established successful working relationships with various
    stakeholders including parents, school staff, service providers, and
    community members to assess and support specialized needs of children and
    families. Her hope is through collaboration and transparency, she can
    support our public schools to work towards creative solutions that ensure
    success for all students within the community.
